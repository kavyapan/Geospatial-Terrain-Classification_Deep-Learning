# Geospatial-Terrain-Classification_Deep-Learning
The aim of the project is to  develop a geospatial terrain identification model using satellite images . The requirements of terrain identification range  from urban planning, Network Planning, natural resource management to disaster response and military operations . 

### Data Understanding-Geospatial Data 
EuroSAT dataset is based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery covering 13 spectral bands and consists of 10 LULC classes with a total of 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images. Satellite image data comes as tiff image with 12 bands and different spatial resolution.For this project, will be using RGB data includes the optical R, G and B frequency bands (B2, B3, B4) encoded as JPEG images bands . These images have spatial resolution of 10m (area covered by each pixel) acquired from patches of images of U Sentinel 2 (2A and 2B) satellites.
